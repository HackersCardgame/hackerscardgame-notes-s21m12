Hi Jacob Edward 

the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnqoAlD8PmI is not that good

1:17: "they can diagnose mental illness"
=> yes they can, but if you do deserved criticism you will run into problems, if the subconsciousness of the shrink says: "Yes that criticism is deserved" and he did already made mistake i would need to gloss over this specific thing and would normally show avoidance behavior talking about this sort of mistake he already made and therefor maybe give more anti-psychotics because he knows that anti psychotics reduces the intelligence and therefor the deserved criticism

further in switzerland it is institutional, if shrink A decides that patient needs this and that drogue you can not change it later because it's then the justice and shrink B forces you to take the drugs even if it's the wrong dosis or the worng drug, that's called Diffusion of responsibility 

2:30: taliking about money does not help the patients and he is phillosopher, WTF!

4:30: ... if you have drugs the cases should go down
=> normally if someone get's drugs all people think the drugs will magically fix the disease and therefor invest less time to help the patient putting all responsibility for the mental health to the drugs. Niklass Luhmann says: "A system needs to be taken care of all the time and must be fixed all the time" psyche or social things are also Systems, people diagnosed with eg. schizophrenia like me would need more support from people that really care, but people with low intelligence or people that dont really want to help are definitively not useful but make everything worse

8:15: bringing kids into this discussion is manipulative

10:30: the examples he brings are episodic and not eg some meta-study of science papers about schizophrenia [1]


more vulnerable to bad or stupid behavior of people

17:30: Schizophrenia again episodic quotes instead of meta-study

18:30: drugs cause schizophrenia is also wrong, but to much drugs cause side effects that makes the life of a patient worse than he just would have schizophrenia

23:00: the drugs cause the problem is maybe wrong, having to much dopamine has as far as i found out the same effect like taking cocaine, being in this state is addictive for the patients so they feel pain if their dopamine is reduced with drugs, the problem is that shrinks don't see that one could adjust the sweet spot with maybe less of this drug where the patient still feels good but not decompensates

further he does not really work scientificly that is described here:

IMAGE:
the dopamine has influence on each single neuron, on the bias and the weight (german: Gewicht) of the neuron, so Inputs (German: Eingabe) triggers earlier an effect on the output (German: Ausgabe) of the Neuron than people with less dopamine in the brain. In my opinion it would be helpful to help the patients to fix wrong content, but since the drug does things people think it's not my departement to help the patient, shrinks and drugs shall do, and that's the only point i agree with Stefan: "our society becomes more and more egoists"
