1:17: "they can diagnose mental illness"
=> yes they can, but if you do deserved criticism you will run into problems, if the subconsciousness of the shrink says: "Yes that criticism is deserved" and he did already made mistake i would need to gloss over this specific thing and would normally show avoidance behavior talking about this sort of mistake he already made and therefor maybe give more anti-psychotics because he knows that anti psychotics reduces the intelligence and therefor the deserved criticism

2:30: taliking about money does not help the patients and he is phillosopher, WTF!

4:30: ... if you have drugs the cases should go down
=> normally if someone get's drugs all people think the drugs will magically fix the disease and therefor invest less time to help the patient putting all responsibility for the mental health to the drugs. Niklass Luhmann says: "A system needs to be taken care of all the time and must be fixed all the time" psyche or social things are also Systems, people diagnosed with eg. schizophrenia like me would need more support from people that really care, but people with low intelligence or people that dont really want to help are definitively not useful but make everything worse
